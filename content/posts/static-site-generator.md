For years I've been using a CMS to manage my personal sites. None of them were ever
particularly large as far as content was concerned, and for good reason. Portfolio
sites and personal blogs are meant to be small, and while many are short on content,
so many more are big on bloatware.

I have been planning a redesign for a while. Going into it, I wanted to make sure
there was a heavy focus on performance, accessibility, ease of use, and compatability.
So I decided to harness the powers of Twig and Markdown Frontmatter to get the ball
rolling.

[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) is a templating engine that outputs HTML.
